properties of normal distribution :
1.dataset which follow normal distribution
the mean,median,mode are equal {there are at their peak}

2.y axis the the probablity{frequency}
3. symetrical nature {mean divided into 2 equal parts }
4.68% of the data lies within 1st standrad deviation(between mean-sd to mean+sd)
5.95% of the data lies within 2nd standrad deviation(between mean-2sd to mean+2sd)
6.99% of the data lies within 3rd standrad deviation(between mean-3sd to mean+3sd)
